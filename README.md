## 📚 About The Project

NetPractice is a 42 School project designed to teach fundamental networking concepts through practical configuration exercises. This browser-based simulator helps students understand TCP/IP addressing, subnetting, and network device configuration.

**Key Features:**
- 10 progressively challenging levels
- Real-time configuration validation
- Practical network troubleshooting
- Browser-based interface

## 🏁 Getting Started

### 🛠️ Installation
1. Download the project files from the 42 intranet
2. Extract the ZIP archive
3. Open `index.html` in your browser

### 🖥️ Usage
1. Enter your 42 intranet login when prompted
2. Complete all 10 levels by configuring network devices
3. For each level:
   - Analyze the network diagram
   - Configure IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways
   - Click "Check again" to validate
   - Use "Get my config" to save your solution

## 🌐 Network Concepts Covered
| Concept               | Description                          | Example Level |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------|
| Basic IP Addressing   | Configure hosts on same network      | Level 1       |
| Subnetting            | Divide networks into subnets         | Level 3       |
| Router Configuration  | Set up routing between networks      | Level 5       |
| DHCP Basics           | Understand automatic IP assignment   | Level 7       |
| NAT Configuration     | Network Address Translation          | Level 10      |

## 📝 Level Solutions
All completed configuration files are available in this repository:
```
level1.conf
level2.conf
...
level10.conf
```

## 🧠 Learning Resources
1. [TCP/IP Addressing Basics](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc791.txt)
2. [Subnetting Practice Guide](https://www.subnetting.net/)
3. [Cisco Networking Academy](https://www.netacad.com/)

## 📜 Evaluation Criteria
1. **Completeness**: All 10 levels correctly configured
2. **Understanding**: Ability to explain configurations during defense
3. **Speed**: Complete 3 random levels within 15 minutes during evaluation
4. **Accuracy**: Correct use of IP addressing and subnetting

### 💡 Pro Tips
- Master binary to decimal conversion for subnetting
- Practice calculating network ranges quickly
- Understand the difference between public and private IPs
- Learn common port numbers (HTTP=80, HTTPS=443, etc.)
